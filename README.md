# Design patterns by Rahul

#Singleton design pattern

*Singleton pattern restricts the instantiation of a class and ensures that only one instance of the class exists in the Java Virtual Machine.
*The singleton class must provide a global access point to get the instance of the class.
*Singleton pattern is used for logging, drivers objects, caching, and thread pool.
